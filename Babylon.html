      In Persian mythology, Zarik (or Zarich) is a Daeva in the service of Ahriman. Oft-depicted in female form, Zarik is the daeva personification of aging. She is very masculine. Her amesha rival counterpart is Ameretat.
The names of the dual demons Taurvi and Zairicha personify, in later texts at least, fever and thirst. They occur together and are mentioned in two places in the Younger Avesta, yet without any special description of their work. They are in the Pahlavi texts depicted as the adversaries of the dual divinities Haurvatat and Ameretat.
